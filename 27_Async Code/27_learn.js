// *************** Async Code ***************

// By Default
// JavaScript -> 1) Synchronous
//               2) Single Threaded

// Execution Context
// Execution one line of code at a time
// Each operation waits for the last one to complete before the execution

// Blocking Code VS Non-Blocking Code
// Blocking Code - Block the flow of Program (Read File Sync)
// Non Blocking Code - Does not block execution (Read file Async)

// Note : Depends on use-cases which code method to use
